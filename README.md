This is a simple project to illustrate initial concepts on:
    - Mathematical modeling and optimization
    - Pyomo
    - Process systems engineering
    - highs solver

Before running main.py, type in the command line the following: pip install -r requirements.txt 

File linear_blending_model.pdf constains the mathematical model and explanations of the blending problem.
